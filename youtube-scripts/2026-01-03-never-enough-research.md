## HOOK (0:00-0:25)

**OPTION 1 (Question + Stakes):**

[TALKING HEAD]

How many years have you been researching your family?

Five? Ten? Twenty?

[PAUSE]

And how many finished stories have you shared with your family?

[B-ROLL: Stacks of folders, overflowing files]

If the answer is "zero"—this video is for you.

Because you're waiting for something that's never coming.

---

**OPTION 2 (Statement + Intrigue):**

[TALKING HEAD]

Your research will never be complete.

[PAUSE]

And that's actually the best news you'll hear today.

Let me explain.

---

## PROBLEM (0:25-2:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

You're waiting to start writing until your research is "complete."

I know—because every family historian I work with says the same thing:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Not yet. I need more research first."]

And it makes sense. You want to get it right. You don't want gaps. You don't want to publish something and then find out you missed something important.

[B-ROLL: Person scrolling through Ancestry, clicking through records]

So you keep researching.

Every record you find raises three new questions.

[SCREEN: Family tree with question marks]

Every answer reveals two more gaps.

The finish line keeps moving.

[TALKING HEAD]

Meanwhile... your family has read nothing.

[PAUSE]

Here's what I need you to hear:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "It will never be complete."]

Your research will never be complete. That's the nature of genealogy.

But your STORIES can be complete.

And there's a massive difference.

## CONTENT (2:15-7:30)

### What Waiting Actually Costs (2:15-3:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Let me tell you about Susan.

Susan spent 15 years researching her grandmother.

[B-ROLL: Immigration records, census forms, old documents]

She had everything. Immigration records. Naturalization papers. Census data. Draft cards. Death certificate.

[TALKING HEAD]

Everything except a finished story.

[PAUSE]

Her mother passed away in 2023.

[B-ROLL: Empty chair at table]

Without ever reading about her own mother's life.

[TALKING HEAD - slower, serious]

Susan had all the research. For years. But she kept waiting for it to be "complete."

And her mom never got to read it.

[PAUSE]

This is what waiting costs.

### What Professional Genealogists Know (3:30-4:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's something the gatekeepers won't admit.

Professional genealogists—the ones who publish books and papers—they publish with gaps too.

[SCREEN: Genealogy journal page with "likely" and "probably" highlighted]

They write "likely" and "probably" and "evidence suggests."

They acknowledge what they don't know.

And they publish anyway.

[TALKING HEAD]

The difference between professional genealogists and everyone else isn't that they have complete research.

It's that they don't let incomplete research stop them from publishing.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "They publish with gaps."]

Read that again.

They. Publish. With. Gaps.

So can you.

### David's Story (4:45-5:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

David researched his grandfather's entire WWII service for 30 years.

[B-ROLL: WWII photos, military documents]

Thousands of hours. Hundreds of documents. Maps. Unit histories. Service records.

Thirty years of meticulous research.

[TALKING HEAD]

Zero finished pages.

He knew everything about his grandfather's four years in the war.

But he couldn't figure out how to write it all.

[PAUSE]

Then he made one shift.

He wrote about ONE day.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "June 6, 1944"]

D-Day. What his grandfather saw. What he felt. What he survived.

Four pages.

[TALKING HEAD]

His son called him. They talked for an hour about his grandfather—

[PAUSE]

—for the first time in their lives.

Not because David finally completed his research.

Because he finally stopped waiting.

---

### The Question That Changes Everything (5:45-6:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

Stop asking:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Is my research complete?"]

Start asking:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Do I have enough for ONE story about ONE moment?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Birth date? Death date? One significant event?

That's enough.

[B-ROLL: Single photograph of ancestor]

You don't need to know everything about your ancestor's 80 years on earth.

You need to know enough to write about ONE day. ONE decision. ONE moment that mattered.

[TALKING HEAD]

Susan's grandmother lived 85 years. But the story that made Susan's daughter cry?

It was about ONE week. Her first week in America.

That's it. One week out of 85 years.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "One moment. That's enough."]

---

### What This Looks Like (6:45-7:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

One of our members proved this to herself:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I finished the story of an ancestor I knew very little about."]

[TALKING HEAD]

She didn't wait for complete research. She wrote with what she had.

And she finished.

Another member described it this way:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I have such a feeling of relief in knowing how to accomplish my goal."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading]

"I was able to gather all the relevant materials, organize them, and then with the help of AI, I now have stories worth reading. I feel like I've taken a pile of 'stuff' and spun it into wonderful stories. Those stories will be enjoyed for generations."

[PAUSE]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "complete" research. Stories worth reading.

That's the goal.

---

## STORY/PROOF (7:30-8:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's the shift.

Susan finally wrote her grandmother's story. With gaps still remaining.

[B-ROLL: Someone typing, finishing a document]

Her daughter's response:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Mom, this is beautiful. I had no idea Grandma went through all that. Do you have more?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "Mom, where are the missing facts?"

Not "Mom, what about the gap in 1923?"

"This is beautiful. Do you have more?"

[PAUSE]

Your family isn't grading your research.

They're waiting for connection.

And connection comes from stories—even imperfect, incomplete stories.

---

## CTA (8:30-9:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

The research will never be done. That's the nature of genealogy.

But the stories can be.

[B-ROLL: Family reading together]

Your family isn't waiting for complete research. They're waiting for you to share what you already know—in a format they can actually read.

[TALKING HEAD]

You've been researching for years. Maybe decades.

What if you spent the next 10 days finishing ONE story?

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "One ancestor. One moment. One story."]

If you want help doing exactly that, I've got a free community where family historians finish stories—not just collect records.

Link in the description.

[TALKING HEAD]

And if perfectionism is what's really stopping you—not research—watch this video next. Because that's a different trap entirely.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Subscribe for more"]

Your research is enough.

Now go finish something.
