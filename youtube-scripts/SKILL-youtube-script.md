# YouTube Script Writing Skill

## Purpose
Create engaging YouTube scripts for Chronicle Makers that convert viewers into community members.

## Video Format
- **Length:** 8-12 minutes (medium form)
- **Style:** Mixed format - talking head segments + B-roll/screen recordings + voiceover sections
- **Pacing:** ~150 words per minute for comfortable delivery

## Script Structure

### 1. HOOK (0:00-0:30) — 75 words max
- Open with a pain point or provocative question
- Pattern interrupt - something unexpected
- Promise the payoff
- NO "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel"

### 2. PROBLEM (0:30-2:00) — 200-250 words
- Validate their struggle
- Show you understand the emotional weight
- Use specific examples (scattered files, decades of research, family who doesn't care)
- Build tension before offering solution

### 3. SOLUTION/CONTENT (2:00-9:00) — 800-1000 words
- Deliver the actual value
- Use the 3-5 key points structure
- Include specific, actionable steps
- Mix formats:
  - [TALKING HEAD] for personal stories, emotional moments
  - [B-ROLL] for demonstrations, examples
  - [SCREEN] for showing AI tools, websites, documents
- Use transition phrases between points

### 4. STORY/PROOF (9:00-10:30) — 200 words
- Member success story or personal example
- Specific transformation (before → after)
- Emotional resonance

### 5. CTA (10:30-11:30) — 100-150 words
- Single clear action (subscribe, join free community, download resource)
- Remind them of the transformation
- Soft sell, not pushy
- Tease next video if applicable

## Voice & Tone

### DO:
- Speak directly to viewer ("you" not "you guys")
- Use conversational language
- Include moments of encouragement with edge
- Acknowledge the real emotional struggle
- Be specific (names, numbers, concrete examples)
- Match Susan's need for encouragement OR David's need for practical efficiency based on topic

### DON'T:
- Academic or lecturing tone
- Gatekeeping language
- Vague platitudes ("just believe in yourself")
- Overly sales-y CTAs
- Politics or cultural signaling
- Talking down to the viewer

## Format Markers

Use these markers in scripts for production:

```
[TALKING HEAD] - Denyse on camera
[B-ROLL: description] - Supplementary footage
[SCREEN: description] - Screen recording or graphic
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "exact text"] - Lower thirds or callouts
[PAUSE] - Beat for emphasis
[CUT TO] - Scene transition
```

## Target Audience Reminders

**Susan (59, emotional, needs encouragement):**
- Overwhelmed by scattered research
- Blocked by perfectionism
- Wants clarity and confidence
- Responds to: warmth, reassurance, "you can do this"

**David (62, practical, needs efficiency):**
- Focused on accuracy and evidence
- Wants streamlined tools and process
- Responds to: practical steps, time-saving, concrete results

## RETENTION PRINCIPLES

### The Art of Retention = Completion + Satisfaction
- Great concept
- Great intro
- Driving storyline or mission with progression
- Pay-off at end
- Content that exceeds expectation

### Retention Factors
- **Viewers:** Core, casual, new (new = lower retention)
- **Traffic source:** External = lower retention
- **Video length:** 50% retention on 30min = top 1%
- **Device type:** Mobile = shorter watch time

### Ten Principles of Retention

1. **Spend disproportionate time on first minute**
2. **Cut out filler** - no fluff
3. **Don't overcomplicate**
4. **Time to action < 20 seconds**
5. **Time to satisfaction** - deliver dopamine hits
6. **Lengthen 'hold' sections < 90 seconds:**
   - Strong storylines
   - Interesting challenges
   - Action sequences
7. **Shorten "fall out" sections:**
   - Transitions → make shorter
   - Over-dwell after story resolution → cut down
   - Sponsors & CTAs → hook next story before
   - Repetition → cut it out
   - Bad/boring content → cut it out
   - Drawn out ending → end faster
8. **Avoid repetition** - no one-dimensional pacing
9. **Story > Production Value** (Casey Neistat principle)
10. **Prioritize Viewer Experience (VX)** - no loud SFX, inconsistent audio, clear footage

### Timeline Pacing Diagram
```
[---digestible segments---][---longer sections & depth---][Quick end]
```
- Start fast & digestible
- Build depth in middle
- End fast
- Avoid repetitive pacing
- Slower moments with less cuts during important context
- Faster cuts with humor & effects during less important moments

## WRITING A PERFECT INTRO

### Intro Must:
- Deliver on promise of title
- Only share necessary context (90% share too much!)
- Seamlessly flow into first storyline
- Visually reaffirm the thumbnail
- Verbally reaffirm the title
- Make viewer feel they made the right decision
- Be intriguing
- Set up roadmap
- Cut straight into action with bridging sentence
- Not feel like an intro
- Include subtle proof points of authority
- Demonstrate effort from the start
- Lean into the story

### Effective Intro Formats

1. **Statement + Intrigue:** "This is a Coke can. But this is one of a kind."
2. **Question + Promise:** "This is a Coke can. It's shinier than others. We'll figure out why."
3. **Analogy/Story + Relevance to topic**
4. **Immediate action followed by context**

### Intro Writing Workflow
1. Write 3 intro options
2. Record & send to others
3. Get feedback
4. Record final 2 options

## STORYTELLING STRUCTURES

### Choose One Per Video:

### 1. Three-Act Narrative
**Structure:** Set-up → Conflict → Resolution

- **Act 1:** Inciting incident / Plot point 1
- **Act 2:** Midpoint / Plot point 2
- **Act 3:** Climax

**Key principles:**
- Ensure clear mission & motivation
- Inciting incident should feel real, not forced
- Stakes built in Act 1
- Midpoint should be a twist/change
- Plot point 2 should aim to overcome twist
- Climax should be very short

### 2. Progression Curve
**Structure:** Intro → Progressive Build Up → Outro

**Concept:** Thing gets more & more (e.g., "$1 vs. $100,000,000 House")

**Key principles:**
- Start with benchmark
- 1st piece should be interesting
- Progression should not just be "gets better"
- Heavily rely on foreshadowing
- Keep escalation moving with subplots & twists

### 3. Puzzle List
**Structure:** Question → Pieces (1, 2, 3, 4) → Answer

**Concept:** Investigation together - show pieces

**Key principles:**
- Intro should make people care about the puzzle
- Why should they invest time? (proof, authority, possession of knowledge)
- 1st piece needs to be good
- Use bridging sentences to tie pieces together
- Consistent reminder of why each section is part of bigger goal

## RETENTION DEVICES

Use these during outline phase:

### Foreshadowing
- Tease upcoming storylines
- Can be subtle or obvious
- Easy to use in every format

### B Plot
- Secondary storyline that supplements A plot
- Example: A plot = Finding fossil, B plot = Surprising teacher

### Revisit Storyline
- Return to a thread multiple times (1:12, 2:26, 5:12)
- Creates stakes & additional hooks
- Can be used in many formats

### Seamless Integration
- Mitigate retention fallout
- Tease upcoming story
- Make transitions feel natural

### Bridging Sentences
- Connect points smoothly
- Fast & smooth delivery
- Can be done in voiceover

### "Soon Y, First X"
- Tease something upcoming
- Jump into something interesting first
- Creates 2nd hook

### Reaffirming the Mission
- Remind viewers of the mission
- Direct call outs
- Subtle mentions
- Use other characters/voices (creators sleep on this!)

## CREATING STAKES

Choose one or more:
- Create an enemy to overcome
- Set a transformation to achieve
- Set a time limit
- Give yourself a doubter (could be yourself)
- Attempt impossible
- Investigate something important
- Solve a problem/issue

## EDITING PRINCIPLES (Paddy's Rules)

### Core Principles
- Everything must be motivated & relevant
- Start fast & digestible, build depth, end fast
- Avoid repetitive pacing - keep it varied
- Avoid one-dimensional editing
- Give everything time to be processed

### Technical Rules
- Avoid dark/grainy footage
- Don't showboat with editing
- Avoid stock B-roll
- Music must match mood
- Use captions sparingly (intro, climax, dialogue)
- Don't put popup captions in 2 different places

- [ ] Is there a clear mission/motivation?
- [ ] Are retention devices placed in outline?
- [ ] Is the intro < 30 seconds with necessary context only?
- [ ] Does the ending resolve quickly?

## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Footage to Publish Process
