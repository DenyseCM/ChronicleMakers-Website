## HOOK (0:00-0:25)

**OPTION 1 (Question + Twist):**

[TALKING HEAD]

Quick question: Which ancestor have you researched the most?

[PAUSE]

Now—have you written their story yet?

[B-ROLL: Boxes of research files]

I'm guessing no.

And that's not a coincidence.

Because the ancestor you know the MOST about is probably the WORST choice for your first story.

Let me explain.

---

**OPTION 2 (Contrarian Statement):**

[TALKING HEAD]

Everything you believe about picking your first family story is wrong.

[PAUSE]

You think you should start with your most-researched ancestor.

You think more knowledge means easier writing.

[B-ROLL: Overflowing filing cabinet]

The opposite is true.

And once you understand why, you'll finally finish something.

---

## PROBLEM (0:25-2:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what's happening in your head:

"I should write about Great-Grandpa. I've researched him for years. I know everything about him. It should be the easiest."

[B-ROLL: Person sitting at desk with massive stack of notes]

So you sit down to write.

And you're immediately overwhelmed.

[SCREEN: Document with dozens of bullet points]

40 pages of notes. Every fact feels important. You can't figure out what to include and what to cut.

[TALKING HEAD]

Where do you start? His childhood? His immigration? His marriage? His career?

[B-ROLL: Person closing laptop, frustrated]

So you close the computer.

"I'll figure it out later."

[TALKING HEAD]

Sound familiar?

[PAUSE]

Here's the truth nobody tells you:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The more you know, the harder it is to write."]

The more you know about someone, the harder it is to write about them.

Because you're not just writing. You're CHOOSING.

And when everything feels important, choosing is paralyzing.

## CONTENT (2:00-7:00)

### Barbara's Breakthrough (2:00-3:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Barbara spent decades researching her great-great-grandfather.

[B-ROLL: Genealogy research materials, old photos]

The family patriarch. Immigrant success story. The "important" one.

She had boxes of research.

[TALKING HEAD]

Couldn't write a single page.

[PAUSE]

Then someone asked her a question that changed everything:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Which ancestor could you write about in 2 pages that would make your daughter cry?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "which ancestor is most important."

Not "which ancestor do you know the most about."

Which one could you write in 2 pages that would make your daughter CRY?

[PAUSE]

Barbara thought about it.

And she picked someone completely different.

---

### The Unexpected Choice (3:30-4:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Barbara picked her great-grandmother instead.

[B-ROLL: Old photograph of woman]

Not the patriarch. Not the "important" one.

A widow at 28 with four kids. Ran a boarding house. Kept the family together.

[TALKING HEAD]

Barbara wrote 3 pages.

One weekend.

[PAUSE]

Her daughter's response:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Mom, I'm crying. I had no idea women could be that strong back then. She's my hero now."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "Mom, why didn't you write about the patriarch?"

Her daughter found a hero she didn't know existed.

Because Barbara stopped trying to write the "important" story and wrote the FINISHABLE one.

---

### The Counterintuitive Truth (4:30-5:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's the pattern our members discover over and over.

One member said:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I finished the story of an ancestor I knew very little about."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading]

"I was able to focus more on the story and the process without falling too far behind. I'm happy with my finished product."

[TALKING HEAD]

Did you catch that? An ancestor she knew VERY LITTLE about.

Less research. More focus. Finished product.

Another member:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I finished an important story of my grandfather's journey from alcoholism to sobriety!"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Notice: not his whole life. One journey. One transformation. One story.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Smaller scope = higher completion rate"]

The pattern is clear: Smaller scope equals higher completion rate.

---

### What Your First Story Should Look Like (5:30-6:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Your first story should have three qualities.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "1. Clear arc"]

**Number one: A clear arc.**

Beginning, struggle, resolution. You should be able to describe the story in one sentence.

[TALKING HEAD]

"She was widowed at 28 and kept her family together by running a boarding house."

That's a story. It has a beginning, a struggle, and a resolution.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "2. Limited scope"]

**Number two: Limited scope.**

One event. One decision. One moment.

[TALKING HEAD]

Not their whole life. Not everything you know about them.

One moment that mattered.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "3. Finishable"]

**Number three: Finishable.**

[TALKING HEAD]

Something you can complete in days, not months.

2-4 pages. Not 40.

[PAUSE]

Save your most-researched ancestor for later—when you have 5-10 finished stories under your belt and know how to handle complexity.

---

### The 3 Questions to Ask (6:30-7:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's how to pick the right first story.

Ask yourself three questions:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "1. Do I have a clear turning point?"]

**One: Do I have a clear turning point?**

One moment that changed everything for them?

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "2. Can I tell it in 2-4 pages?"]

**Two: Can I tell it in 2-4 pages?**

Not their whole life. One story.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "3. Will my family connect emotionally?"]

**Three: Will my family connect emotionally?**

Struggle. Sacrifice. Love. Survival.

[TALKING HEAD]

If you can answer yes to all three—that's your first story.

Not the one you think you "should" write.

The one you can FINISH.

---

## STORY/PROOF (7:00-7:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what happens when you make this shift.

You stop feeling paralyzed by your most-researched ancestor.

You pick someone simpler.

You FINISH.

[B-ROLL: Printed story, someone reading it]

And then something surprising happens.

[TALKING HEAD]

You gain confidence. You understand the process. You know what works.

And suddenly, that complex patriarch story? The one with 40 pages of notes?

It doesn't seem so impossible anymore.

Because you've done it before. Just with someone easier first.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Confidence comes from finishing."]

Your most-researched ancestor will still be there after you've finished 5 stories.

But right now, you need momentum.

---

## CTA (7:45-8:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Your most-researched ancestor isn't going anywhere.

But your confidence? Your momentum? Your family waiting to read something?

That won't wait forever.

[B-ROLL: Person smiling, finishing a document]

Pick the simpler story. Write it. Share it.

Then tackle the complex one with skills and confidence you've built.
