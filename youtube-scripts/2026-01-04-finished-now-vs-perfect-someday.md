## HOOK (0:00-0:25)

**OPTION 1 (Direct Challenge):**

[TALKING HEAD]

You have drafts on your computer right now.

Maybe not finished. Maybe "80% done."

[PAUSE]

But you've never shared them.

[B-ROLL: Computer folder with documents labeled "draft," "final v2," "FINAL final"]

And I know exactly why.

"It's not perfect yet."

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's the truth your perfectionism doesn't want you to hear.

---

**OPTION 2 (Story Opening):**

[TALKING HEAD]

Margaret had a draft about her grandmother. "Mostly done" for eight months.

Then her aunt passed away.

[PAUSE]

The aunt who would have loved reading about her own mother.

[TALKING HEAD]

Margaret's story sat on her hard drive while her aunt was still alive.

Let me tell you what happened next—and why it changed everything for her.

---

## PROBLEM (0:25-2:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what perfectionism sounds like:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "It's not perfect yet."]

"I need to check one more thing."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I need to check one more thing."]

"What if there's an error?"

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "What if there's an error?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

So your drafts sit. Weeks turn into months. Months turn into years.

[B-ROLL: Calendar pages flipping, dust gathering on folders]

Meanwhile, your family reads nothing.

[PAUSE]

Margaret's draft about her grandmother was "mostly done" for eight months.

[TALKING HEAD]

She kept finding reasons not to share it:
- Needed better citations
- Wanted to verify one more date
- Wasn't sure about the ending

[B-ROLL: Person reviewing document, shaking head]

Then her aunt passed away suddenly.

[PAUSE]

The aunt who would have loved reading about her mother.

[TALKING HEAD - slower]

Eight months that draft sat on her computer.

Her aunt was alive for all of them.

[PAUSE]

This is what perfectionism costs.

## CONTENT (2:00-7:00)

### What Your Family Actually Cares About (2:00-3:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's the truth your inner perfectionist doesn't want you to hear.

Your family isn't grading your work.

[B-ROLL: Teacher with red pen - crossed out]

They don't care if you said "emigrated" instead of "immigrated."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "emigrated ≠ immigrated" with checkmark]

They don't care if one date is approximate.

They don't care if your citations aren't in Evidence Explained format.

[TALKING HEAD]

They care that someone finally wrote down Grandma's story.

[PAUSE]

When Margaret finally shared her "imperfect" draft with her cousins, their response was:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Why didn't you share this sooner? This is wonderful. Do you have more?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "Why didn't you verify that date?"

Not "Your citation format is wrong."

"Why didn't you share this sooner?"

[PAUSE]

They wanted it. They were waiting for it.

And she almost waited too long.

---

### The Hard Truth About "Almost Done" (3:15-4:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

I need you to hear this.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Stories untold are stories forgotten."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Your "almost done" draft sitting on your hard drive?

It's functionally the same as no draft at all.

[B-ROLL: Hard drive, files sitting unused]

If no one reads it, it doesn't exist.

If your family never sees it, it might as well have never been written.

[TALKING HEAD]

The perfect story you never share is worth less than the imperfect story your grandkids read at your funeral.

[PAUSE]

That's not meant to be dark. That's meant to be a wake-up call.

The stories matter. But only if they get out of your computer.

### How to Break Free From Perfectionism (4:15-5:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

One of our members described this transformation perfectly:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "My main goal was to loosen the grip perfectionism had on me."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading]

"I learned how to sit down and write even when the words came out rough at first. Instead of stopping to polish every sentence, I practiced moving forward—trusting that I could shape things later."

[PAUSE]

[TALKING HEAD]

That shift—"I can shape things later"—is everything.

Perfectionism tells you it has to be right the first time.

The truth is: revision exists. Drafts are meant to be imperfect.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Drafts are meant to be imperfect."]

She continued:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I began sharing drafts with others—something I never would have done before."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading]

"Hearing their encouragement reminded me that I'm not doing this work alone. It helped me build confidence in my own voice."

[TALKING HEAD]

Did you catch that? She shared DRAFTS. Not finished work. Drafts.

And that's what built her confidence to finish.

### Why Deadlines Beat Motivation (5:45-7:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's the uncomfortable truth.

Without a deadline, you'll "polish" forever.

[B-ROLL: Person endlessly editing same document]

Motivation doesn't work against perfectionism. Deadlines do.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Deadlines beat motivation."]

[TALKING HEAD]

In our 10-Day Sprint, Day 10 is mandatory sharing day.

Ready or not, you send your story to at least one family member.

[PAUSE]

90% of participants do it.

And their families love it.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "90% share on Day 10"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not because they're better writers. Not because their stories are perfect.

Because they have a deadline that makes perfectionism irrelevant.

When you HAVE to share on Day 10, you stop asking "Is it perfect?" and start asking "Is it done enough?"

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Done enough > Perfect"]

That's the shift.

---

## STORY/PROOF (7:00-8:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what this looks like in practice.

One member said:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I completed the story on my grandfather and shared it with my siblings."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "I perfected the story." She completed it. And shared it.

Another described the deeper change:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The biggest change is that I no longer feel stuck."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading]

"I'm writing with more ease, taking risks, and letting the story grow naturally. That's the progress I'm most proud of."

[PAUSE]

[TALKING HEAD]

Taking risks. Letting the story grow.

That's what freedom from perfectionism sounds like.

[B-ROLL: Person confidently hitting "send" on email]

It's not about lowering your standards. It's about trusting that done is valuable—even when it's not perfect.

---

## CTA (8:00-8:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

If you've been "almost done" with a story for months—or years—the problem isn't the story.

It's the absence of a deadline and the presence of perfectionism.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Finished imperfect beats perfect someday."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Your family doesn't need perfection. They need connection.

They need to know where they came from.

They need YOU to share what you've already written.

[B-ROLL: Family member opening email, smiling while reading]

If you want a deadline that actually works—and a community that will help you hit it—link to our free community is in the description.

[TALKING HEAD]

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Subscribe for more"]

Your drafts are waiting.

Your family is waiting.

Stop polishing. Start sharing.
