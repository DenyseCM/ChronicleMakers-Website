## HOOK (0:00-0:25)

[TALKING HEAD]

**OPTION 1 (Statement + Intrigue):**
"My kids aren't interested in family history."

[PAUSE]

I hear this constantly. And if you've said it yourself... you're right.

[B-ROLL: Family gathering, someone talking, others looking at phones]

Sort of.

Your kids don't care about your research. But they desperately care about who they are and where they came from.

There's a disconnect—and today I'm going to show you exactly what it is and how to fix it.

---

**OPTION 2 (Immediate Action + Context):**
[B-ROLL: Thanksgiving dinner table]

Robert talked about his genealogy research at every family gathering. For years. Eyes glazed over. His kids changed the subject.

[TALKING HEAD]

He assumed they didn't care.

Then he did ONE thing differently—and his son called him an hour later in tears.

Same facts. Same ancestors. Completely different reaction.

I'll show you what changed.

---

**OPTION 3 (Question + Promise):**
[TALKING HEAD]

Why does your family's eyes glaze over every time you mention your genealogy research?

[B-ROLL: Person showing phone/documents to uninterested family member]

It's not that they don't care about family history. They do.

You're just sharing it wrong.

And by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to fix that.

---

## PROBLEM (0:25-2:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what's actually happening.

You spend hours—maybe years—finding records. Census data. Immigration papers. Birth certificates.

[SCREEN: Ancestry.com tree with lots of names and dates]

And when you find something exciting, you want to share it.

So at Thanksgiving, you say:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I found Great-Grandpa in the 1920 census!"]

And your daughter nods politely... then asks someone to pass the potatoes.

[B-ROLL: Polite but disengaged family member]

You think: "They just don't care about family history."

But here's what your daughter is actually thinking:

[TALKING HEAD - leaning in]

"Okay... and? What am I supposed to do with that information?"

[PAUSE]

The problem isn't your family. The problem isn't your research.

The problem is the FORMAT.

And that's actually great news—because format is fixable.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Format is fixable."]

Let me show you what I mean.

---

## CONTENT (2:00-8:30)

### The Format Shift (2:00-3:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Watch how the same information lands completely differently.

**Version 1:**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I found Great-Grandpa in the 1920 census."]

Eyes glaze over.

**Version 2:**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Great-Grandpa left Poland with $8 in his pocket and couldn't speak English. Here's what happened in his first week that made our entire family possible."]

[TALKING HEAD]

They lean in.

Same ancestor. Same research. But one is a FACT. The other is a STORY.

[B-ROLL: Old photograph of immigrant family]

Your family doesn't want your research reports. They want to feel connected to where they came from.

And stories create that connection. Facts don't.

Now—I'm going to give you the exact formula for making this shift. But first, let me show you what happens when you get this right.

---

### Robert's Story (3:30-5:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Robert had been researching his family for over a decade.

[B-ROLL: Boxes of genealogy files, photos]

Every holiday, he'd share what he found. His grandfather served on D-Day. He had documents, photos, military records.

[SCREEN: Example military record - blurred/generic]

His kids would nod. Change the subject. He assumed they didn't care.

Then Robert joined our writing sprint and turned those facts into a 4-page story about ONE day—June 6th, 1944. What his grandfather saw. What he felt. What he survived.

[TALKING HEAD]

He didn't announce it. Just emailed it to his son.

[PAUSE]

His son called him an hour later.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Dad, I had no idea. I can't stop thinking about this. Do you have more?"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Same facts Robert had mentioned at Thanksgiving for years.

Different format.

THAT'S what changed everything.

---

### The 3-Part Formula (5:00-7:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

So how do you make this shift? Three things.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "1. One ancestor, one moment"]

**Number one: Pick ONE ancestor and ONE moment.**

Not their whole life. Not every record you found. One turning point.

[B-ROLL: Single photograph of ancestor]

For Robert, it was D-Day. For you, it might be the day your grandmother arrived at Ellis Island. Or the moment your great-grandfather decided to leave everything behind.

One moment that mattered.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "2. Beginning → Middle → End"]

**Number two: Use story structure.**

[TALKING HEAD]

Beginning: What was their world like before?
Middle: What happened that changed everything?
End: Why does this matter to your family today?

That's it. You don't need to be a writer. You need a framework.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "3. Your voice, not a report"]

**Number three: Write in YOUR voice.**

[TALKING HEAD]

Your family doesn't want a research report. They want to hear from YOU.

They want to know why this ancestor matters to you. What you felt when you discovered their story. What you want them to understand.

[B-ROLL: Person writing/typing]

That emotional connection is what makes them lean in.

---

### When They Still Don't Care (7:00-8:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Now—I have to be honest with you.

Sometimes, even when you do everything right... your family still won't react the way you hoped.

[B-ROLL: Person looking at phone, disappointed]

One of our members said this:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "My family is not very interested in these stories, unfortunately. And yet I have all this material passed on to me."]

[TALKING HEAD]

And you know what? That's okay.

Because the point isn't to force your family to care on YOUR timeline.

The point is to FINISH the stories so they exist when someone IS ready.

[B-ROLL: Grandchild discovering old photo album/book]

Your grandkids might not care today. But in 20 years? When they're trying to understand who they are?

Those stories will be there. Because you wrote them.

Another member found a creative solution for reaching the younger generation:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The younger generation connects through images and sound more than reading alone."]

[TALKING HEAD]

She worked with her son to create a video of her telling the stories, with photos added in.

Sometimes it's not just the content—it's finding the right format for YOUR family.

---

## STORY/PROOF (8:30-9:30)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what this transformation actually looks like.

One of our members described it this way:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I have such a feeling of relief in knowing how to accomplish my goal of writing."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading with emotion]

"I was able to gather all the relevant materials, organize and transcribe them, and then with the help of AI, I now have stories worth reading. I feel like I've taken a pile of 'stuff' and spun it into what will become a plethora of wonderful stories. Those stories will then be enjoyed for generations."

[PAUSE]

[TALKING HEAD]

That's the shift. From a pile of stuff to stories that last generations.

Another member put it simply:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I completed the story on my grandfather and shared it with my siblings."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not "I collected more records." Not "I found another census."

She FINISHED. She SHARED. And her family read it.

## CTA (9:30-10:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

Your family cares about where they came from. They're just waiting for you to share it in a way they can connect with.

Stories. Not reports.
One moment. Not a whole life.
Your voice. Not a database.
