## HOOK (0:00-0:20)

[SCREEN: Blank Google Doc, cursor blinking]

**OPTION 1 (Immediate Action + Context):**

[TALKING HEAD]

You've done this before.

Opened a blank document. Stared at it. Typed a sentence.

[SCREEN: Typing a sentence, then selecting and deleting it]

Deleted it.

An hour later: three sentences and a headache.

So you concluded: "I'm just not a writer."

[PAUSE]

Wrong.

You just didn't have a structure.

---

**OPTION 2 (Statement + Intrigue):**

[TALKING HEAD]

Professional writers don't stare at blank pages.

[B-ROLL: Someone writing confidently]

And no—it's not because they have more talent than you.

It's because they have something you don't. Yet.

I'll show you exactly what it is.

## PROBLEM (0:20-1:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

Carol tried to write her grandfather's story for six months.

[B-ROLL: Stack of notes, photos, frustrated person at desk]

She'd sit down. Open a document. Write a paragraph.

Then think: "Wait, should I start earlier? What about his childhood? Am I including too much? Not enough?"

[TALKING HEAD]

She'd close the laptop.

Six months. Same cycle.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I don't know where to begin. I'm not a writer."]

Sound familiar?

Here's what Carol didn't know—and what nobody tells you:

[TALKING HEAD - leaning in]

The blank page isn't the problem.

The ABSENCE of structure is the problem.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "No structure = paralysis"]

You're not staring at a blank page. You're staring at infinite possibilities with no way to choose between them.

That's not a writing problem. That's a framework problem.

And frameworks are learnable.

## CONTENT (1:45-7:00)

### The Secret Professional Writers Know (1:45-3:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's something the gatekeepers don't want you to know.

Professional writers—the ones who publish books, write scripts, create content for a living—they don't sit down with a blank page and wait for inspiration.

[B-ROLL: Author at desk with outline visible]

They use structures.

Every story you've ever loved follows the same pattern:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Beginning → Middle → End"]

[TALKING HEAD]

Beginning: Establish the world.
Middle: Something changes.
End: Resolution and meaning.

[B-ROLL: Movie scene montage - quick cuts]

That's it. Every movie. Every novel. Every story that's ever made you feel something.

Your ancestor's story is no different.

And once you have this framework, the blank page stops being terrifying—because you know exactly what goes where.

---

### The 3-Part Structure (3:00-5:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Let me show you how this works for family history.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "BEGINNING: Who were they?"]

**Beginning: Who was your ancestor? What was their world like?**

[TALKING HEAD]

This is where you set the scene. Where did they live? What year? What was life like in that place and time?

You're not writing their whole biography. You're establishing context for ONE moment.

[B-ROLL: Old photographs, historical images]

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "MIDDLE: What changed?"]

**Middle: What happened that changed everything?**

[TALKING HEAD]

This is the turning point. The decision. The event.

Maybe they left their country. Maybe they survived something. Maybe they made a choice that made your entire family possible.

THIS is what your family actually wants to read about.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "END: Why does it matter?"]

**End: What came after? Why does this matter to your family today?**

[TALKING HEAD]

This is where you connect the past to the present.

Because of what they did... we exist. Because of their sacrifice... we have this. Because of their courage... you're here.

That's the story. Beginning, middle, end.

[PAUSE]

Now here's what happened when Carol learned this.

---

### Carol's Transformation (5:00-6:15)

[TALKING HEAD]

Remember Carol? Six months of starting and stopping?

She learned this structure.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Beginning: Who was he? What was his world?"]
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Middle: What changed everything?"]
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "End: Why does it matter?"]

She filled it in for her grandfather.

[TALKING HEAD]

One weekend.

Not six months of staring. One weekend of filling in a framework.

[PAUSE]

She sent it to her son.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Dad, you need to read this. This is where we come from."]

[TALKING HEAD]

Not because Carol became a "writer."

Because she had a structure to follow.

---

### What This Feels Like (6:15-7:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's how our members describe this shift.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I learned how to sit down and write even when the words came out rough at first."]

[TALKING HEAD]

One member said: "Instead of stopping to polish every sentence, I practiced moving forward trusting I could shape things later. That shift alone freed me to actually enjoy writing again."

Another said:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "I proved to myself that with patience and a good writing system, I can write a story about my family."]

[TALKING HEAD]

And:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The step-by-step approach really helped me get started AND finish."]

That's the difference. Not talent. Framework.

---

## STORY/PROOF (7:00-8:00)

[TALKING HEAD]

One more thing.

Our members describe the same transformation over and over:

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The biggest change is that I no longer feel stuck."]

[TALKING HEAD - reading with emphasis]

"I'm writing with more ease, taking risks, and letting the story grow naturally. That's the progress I'm most proud of."

[PAUSE]

[TALKING HEAD]

That feeling—"I no longer feel stuck"—that's what structure gives you.

Not inspiration. Not talent. Just a framework that removes the paralysis of infinite choices.

[B-ROLL: Person typing confidently, pages coming out of printer]

Beginning. Middle. End.

That's all you need to start.

---

## CTA (8:00-8:45)

[TALKING HEAD]

You've stared at blank pages long enough.

The problem was never your ability. It was the absence of a framework.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Beginning → Middle → End"]

With the right structure, you can finish a family story in days—not months of false starts.

[B-ROLL: Printed story, someone reading it]

If you want help using this structure—and the accountability to actually finish—I've got a free community of family historians doing exactly that.

The blank page doesn't have to win.

You just need a framework.
