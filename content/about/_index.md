## Chronicle Makers

**Write the family history only you can tell**

You've spent years uncovering your family's history. You have boxes of documents, scattered research, family stories, and fragments of knowledge.

But somewhere along the way, the work stopped becoming something.

That's because genealogy research and family storytelling are two completely different skills. Most genealogy education teaches you one. I show you how to do both.

## Who I Am

Hi, I'm Denyse Allen. I spent six years as a professional genealogist, and I learned something that changed everything: People don't want professional research reports. They want finished stories—chronicles that bring their ancestors to life in ways their families will actually want to read.

I also mastered Pennsylvania genealogy research, one of the hardest states in America (25 different religious groups, constantly changing boundaries, German language records, and don't get started about that war with Connecticut). That taught me something crucial: If these research techniques work for Pennsylvania, they work for researching ancestors anywhere.

But here's what I discovered was holding people back: It wasn't the research. It was the writing. And it wasn't the complexity. It was permission—permission to start with what they had, permission to write imperfectly, permission to finish.

So I built Chronicle Makers to give you that permission, plus the frameworks and tools to actually do it.

## What Makes This Different

Most genealogy education focuses on finding more. Chronicle Makers focuses on finishing what you have.

We don't teach you how to write professional reports. We teach you how to transform raw research into emotionally compelling stories that your family will treasure. We show you how to use AI as your partner, not to replace your work, but to accelerate it.

And we do it in community. You're not alone in this. You're surrounded by people who are working with the same tools with similar goals as you. You'll feel supported and have momentum like never before.

## The Promise

You don't need to be a professional. You don't need perfect research. You just need a love for your family's history and a willingness to start.

With Chronicle Makers, you'll learn by doing. You'll write your first chronicle faster than you think possible (our community averages 10 days). You'll discover that your research is already enough. And you'll create something your family will treasure forever.

Your ancestors are waiting to be remembered. Let's bring them to life.
