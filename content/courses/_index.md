## Chronicle Makers Labs: Your Family History Workshop

Transform your genealogy research into finished family stories with Chronicle Makers Labs—self-paced courses that teach you to organize decades of scattered files, find essential ancestor records, write compelling family chronicles, and solve brick wall mysteries using AI-powered tools and community support, all while working on your own family history.

**Why "Labs"?** Because this isn't about lectures and theory—it's about rolling up your sleeves and doing the work. Like a scientist in a lab, you'll experiment, test, and create real results with your own family history. Start anytime, work at your own pace, and walk away with something finished.

**No tech wizard required.** Never used AI? That's fine—we teach everything step-by-step as you go. You'll work on YOUR actual ancestors, YOUR real research, YOUR family stories. The community is here to help, plus we meet on weekly calls to work through questions together.
