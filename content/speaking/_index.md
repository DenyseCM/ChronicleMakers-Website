## Transform Your Genealogy Society's Next Meeting Into a Unique Experience

Denyse Allen brings practical, immediately actionable sessions that help genealogists finish the family stories they've been meaning to write for years—transforming decades of research into chronicles their families will actually read and treasure. Founder of Chronicle Makers, an AI-assisted family history community, Denyse specializes in showing family historians how to move from scattered files to published stories through proven systems, supportive community, and smart use of AI tools.

With presentations at RootsTech 2025, NGS Keynote 2024, and genealogy societies nationwide, Denyse brings both expertise and lived experience—she's actively writing 100 chronicles of her own Pennsylvania ancestors, demonstrating every technique she teaches with real family stories.

**Recent Speaking Engagements:**

- RootsTech 2025 (300+ attendees)
- NGS Keynote 2024
- Allen County Public Library Genealogy Center 2024 (400+ attendees)
- Ohio Genealogy Society 2025

### The Chronicle Makers Approach

Unlike traditional genealogy presentations that focus on research techniques alone, Denyse's sessions address the complete journey from curiosity to published legacy. Drawing from Chronicle Makers' proven seven-lab methodology, attendees learn not just how to find ancestors, but how to finish their stories and share them with family.

The difference: Research is just the beginning. Chronicle Makers focuses on what happens next—organizing evidence, writing compelling narratives, and actually completing projects that have sat unfinished for years.

## Featured Topics for 2026

### 1. From Scattered Files to Finished Chronicles: The Complete Research-to-Publishing System

*Recommended for: Mixed audiences, all skill levels*

Most genealogists have years of research sitting in folders, files, and family trees, but struggle to transform that work into stories their families will actually read. This session reveals how AI can bridge the gap between research and writing, helping attendees stay focused on what matters and keep their family engaged in the process.

**What Your Members Will Learn:**

- The 3-stage AI collaboration method (research → organization → narrative)
- How to use AI to identify which ancestors are "story-ready"
- Creative AI prompts that keep family members engaged during research
- The "completion over perfection" framework that gets stories finished

**Interactive Elements:**

- Real-time polls on attendees' biggest bottlenecks
- Live AI demonstration solving audience-suggested ancestor scenarios
- Actionable takeaways participants can implement this week

**Included Handout:** "10 AI Prompts for the Research-to-Writing Pipeline" + "The Story-Ready Checklist"

**What Changes:** Attendees leave knowing exactly which ancestor to start with, what they already have that's "enough," and the first three actions to take this week.

### 2. Breaking Through Brick Walls: AI-Powered Research Strategies That Actually Work

*Recommended for: Intermediate researchers who feel stuck*

Stuck ancestors aren't always stuck—sometimes we just need fresh eyes and new strategies. This session shows how AI can accelerate research by helping genealogists analyze evidence, generate new search strategies, and connect records they might have missed.

**What Your Members Will Learn:**

- How to use AI to analyze what they already have and spot gaps
- The "evidence correlation" technique that connects scattered records
- AI-assisted research planning (stop random searching, start systematic investigating)
- How to use AI to understand complex documents (probate, land records, old handwriting)
- When AI helps vs. when you need human expertise

**Interactive Elements:**

- "Bring Your Brick Wall" - attendees share stuck ancestors, we solve them live using AI
- Real-time polls tracking which techniques resonate most
- Immediate implementation strategies

**Included Handout:** "The Brick Wall Analysis Worksheet" + "15 AI Research Prompts for Stuck Ancestors"

**What Changes:** Attendees discover systematic research strategies that replace random searching, and understand how to build evidence-based cases rather than hunting for single records.

### 3. Write Your First Family Chronicle in 10 Days: The AI-Assisted Story Method

*Recommended for: Researchers ready to write but don't know how to start*

Your members have done the research. They have the facts. But how do they turn that into a story their families will actually want to read? This session reveals the proven 10-day method that helps genealogists complete their first family chronicle—even if they "aren't writers."

**What Your Members Will Learn:**

- The STORI method that structures any family story
- How to use AI to transform facts into narrative without "making things up"
- The "good enough to start" threshold (they have more than they think)
- How to fill gaps with historical context (not fiction)
- Why finishing "version 1.0" matters more than perfect prose

**Interactive Elements:**

- Live "Pick Your Ancestor" exercise - attendees choose which story to write first
- 5-minute writing sprint where attendees draft their ancestor's first paragraph
- Volunteers share their paragraphs in chat for immediate feedback

**Included Handout:** "The 10-Day Chronicle Writing Plan" + "Story Starter Prompts"

**What Changes:** Attendees shift from "I'm not ready" to "I can start now," understanding the threshold for "good enough to begin" and experiencing what 10 days of focused writing can produce.

### 4. AI as Your Genealogy Partner: Beyond ChatGPT Basics to Creative Applications

*Recommended for: Tech-curious genealogists who want to level up their AI skills*

Most genealogists have tried ChatGPT once or twice and weren't impressed. That's because knowing *what* to ask and *how* to collaborate with AI makes all the difference. This session goes beyond basic prompts to show creative, practical ways to use AI throughout the genealogy workflow.

**What Your Members Will Learn:**

- The difference between "asking AI questions" vs. "collaborating with AI" (mindset shift)
- Creative applications: AI-generated family newsletters, ancestor interview questions, research accountability partners
- How to chain multiple AI tools together for complex tasks
- Platform comparison: ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini vs. Perplexity (which for what)
- The "research log assistant" technique that keeps researchers focused and tracks progress

**Interactive Elements:**

- "Creative Challenge" - audience suggests genealogy problems, we brainstorm 5 AI solutions and demonstrate the best one live
- Platform comparison demonstrations
- Real-time polling on which tools attendees will try first

**Included Handout:** "AI Tool Comparison Chart" + "20 Tested Genealogy Prompts"

**What Changes:** Attendees move from AI skepticism or confusion to understanding how to collaborate with AI as a research partner, with clear use cases for different tools and workflows.

**Q: What makes your AI presentations different from others?**
A: My sessions focus on practical collaboration with AI specifically for genealogy workflows—not just "here's ChatGPT." Attendees leave with tested prompts, specific techniques for their research and writing challenges, and the confidence to actually use these tools. As one RootsTech attendee said: "Most helpful session I've attended at RootsTech 2025! I've used ChatGPT to a limited extent and found it helpful, but this truly clarified how I can use it better."

A: No. AI is integrated throughout as an accelerator, but these sessions focus on the complete system—mindset shifts, organizational frameworks, and writing techniques that help family historians actually finish stories. AI makes the process faster and less overwhelming, but the real transformation is learning how to move from endless research to completed chronicles.
